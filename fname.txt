All these problems have to be identified and plans that aim at solving the should be profiled.
To solve these crisis I am propsing that a community made up of individuals armed with values that 
aim to bring about a positive social change.
Individuals with different areas of intrest would be inducted into the community.
Individuals would be indentified as fellows. The point of intrest of fellows shall range from one angle to
another in the social sphere. From leadership to economics, moral value instillers, motivational speakers
etc.

The community would act as the birth place of a new breed of leaders in politics, business and tech
of whose priority would be to liberate Nigeria and ultimately Africa from the shackles of backwardness.

Efforts carried out by out by individuals in the community would be in-tune to the laid down vision the 
and targets the group has for the forward progress of this nation.
